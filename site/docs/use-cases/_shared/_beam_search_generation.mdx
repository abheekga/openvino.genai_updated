#### Optimizing Generation with Grouped Beam Search

Beam search helps explore multiple possible text completions simultaneously, often leading to higher quality outputs.

:::info Understanding Beam Search Generation Parameters

- `max_new_tokens`: The maximum numbers of tokens to generate, excluding the number of tokens in the prompt. `max_new_tokens` has priority over `max_length`.
- `num_beams`: The number of beams for beam search. 1 disables beam search.
- `num_beam_groups`: The number of groups to divide `num_beams` into in order to ensure diversity among different groups of beams.
- `diversity_penalty`: value is subtracted from a beam's score if it generates the same token as any beam from other group at a particular time.

For the full list of generation parameters, refer to the [Generation Config API](https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/api/genai_api/_autosummary/openvino_genai.GenerationConfig.html#openvino-genai-generationconfig).

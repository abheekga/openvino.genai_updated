:::info Understanding Basic Generation Parameters

- `max_new_tokens`: The maximum numbers of tokens to generate, excluding the number of tokens in the prompt. `max_new_tokens` has priority over `max_length`.
- `temperature`: Controls the level of creativity in AI-generated text:
    - Low temperature (e.g. 0.2) leads to more focused and deterministic output, choosing tokens with the highest probability.
    - Medium temperature (e.g. 1.0) maintains a balance between creativity and focus, selecting tokens based on their probabilities without significant bias.
    - High temperature (e.g. 2.0) makes output more creative and adventurous, increasing the chances of selecting less likely tokens.
- `top_k`: Limits token selection to the k most likely next tokens. Higher values allow more diverse outputs.
- `top_p`: Selects from the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds p. Helps balance diversity and quality.
- `repetition_penalty`: Reduces the likelihood of repeating tokens. Values above 1.0 discourage repetition.
